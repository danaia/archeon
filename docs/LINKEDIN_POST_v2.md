I'm an artist who really loves the code.

Built this thing called Archeon in about 30 hours. The idea hit me driving from Pittsburgh to Philly — I've been brainstorming with AI in the car lately, just talking through problems. Got to Philly and I just couldn't stop banging away on it. Coffee shops, hotel room, didn't matter. I needed to see if the idea held up.

So here's what I've been noticing after two years of generating tons of code with AI: these models are genuinely good at coding. But they lose context. They lose structure. They lose the ability to understand how everything fits together. You ask AI to update something and it can become spaghetti code pretty damn quick.

I've been an information architect for a long time and I love solving complex problems. So I realized there's a different way to think about this. It's not about bigger models with more parameters — it's about structure. Architectural coherence. Making it easy for the AI to understand what the structure is, same as the human. And I baseline everything against HCI principles — user journeys, mental models — that's the validator.

So I built Archeon. Small notation. Glyphs that represent architectural pieces. Chains that connect user needs to outcomes. Boundaries that don't move. If you violate a rule, the system just says no.

Once the structure was explicit, even small local models started behaving. Not because they got smarter — because the problem got smaller.

This isn't a product. I'm not selling anything. Fully open source, runs locally in your project directory. Doesn't matter if you're using local models or cloud models, React or Vue or Python — it's flexible and easy to extend. It just sits there as a rule set that gives your AI strict guidance.

I wrote up the thinking on Medium. Technical but also personal — about how constraint shapes behavior, in code and in creative work.
